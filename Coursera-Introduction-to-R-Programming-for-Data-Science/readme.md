<h2 align="center">Summary & Highlights</h2>
- You can use the R programming language to perform statistical computation, data visualization, and predictive analysis. 
- The four most common data types in R are integer, numeric, character, and logical. 
- You can use the class() function and the is.integer(), is.numeric(), is.character(), and is.logical() functions to determine the data type. 
- You can convert some data types to other data types using the as.integer(), as.numeric(), as.character(), and as.logical() functions. 
- R provides math operators that you can use to perform calculations on your data. 
- Using variables in your calculations and providing them with descriptive names can help shorten your code and make it easier to read. 
- You can control the order of operations using parenthesis. 
- The R development environment includes the R console, R script files, and workspaces.  
- Two important tools for working with R code are RStudio and Jupyter. 
- RStudio features, like syntax highlighting and auto code completion, make writing code easier. 
- The main components of RStudio include the File Editor, Console, Workspace, and File, Plots, and Packages Explorer. 
- A Jupyter Notebook is made up of cells that can contain code, markdown files, or raw text.  
- An all-in-one Jupyter Notebook contains narration, code, data, and plots, images, or videos.
